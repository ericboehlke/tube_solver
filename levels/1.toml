# A 2D arraying containing the starting state of all of the tubes
# - The colors start at the bottom and end at the top so it is like the
#   tube is rotated Ï€/2 radians clockwise from what is shown on the app. 
# - The order of the tubes should be the same as in the app so when the
#   program says `pour tube 2 into tube 5` you know which tubes it means.
# - Tubes with fewer than 4 colors will be assumed to be empty on the 
#   remaining layers.
